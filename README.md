# ‚òÅÔ∏è Microsoft Azure DP-900 Fundamentals ‚Äì Data Fundamentals Training

This repository documents my hands-on training experience for the **Microsoft DP-900: Azure Data Fundamentals** certification. The work focuses on exploring how Azure handles relational data, non-relational data, and analytical workloads using its native tools and services.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The project is divided into three core sections that mirror real-world data scenarios within Azure:

1. **Explore Relational Data in Azure**
2. **Explore Non-Relational Data in Azure**
3. **Explore Data Analytics in Azure**

The screenshots reflect direct interaction with Azure SQL, storage accounts, Cosmos DB, Microsoft Fabric environments.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Explore Non-Relational Data in Azure

* Navigated a **Storage Account** to explore **blob containers**, **file shares**, and **tables**.
* Used Azure Storage browser to view items like ‚Äúproducts‚Äù stored in NoSQL-style tables.
* Opened and managed **Cosmos DB** documents using **Data Explorer** with JSON-based schema.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Explore Data Analytics in Azure

* Used **Microsoft Fabric** to visualize telemetry logs over time.
* Built visual reports and charts to explore event volume and distribution.
* Worked within a Fabric workspace to examine datasets and their refresh schedules.
* Connected logs, structured data, and analytics into coherent dashboards.

## ‚úÖ Key Outcomes

* Gained practical skills across **relational** and **non-relational** data management.
* Learned how to analyze both structured and unstructured data inside Azure‚Äôs platform.
* Understood how Microsoft Fabric unifies data ingestion, modeling, and visual reporting.
* Applied **SQL**, **KQL**, and **Azure GUI tools** to interact with live data systems.

## üß† Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive view of Azure's data capabilities‚Äîfrom managing simple storage to advanced analytics. It showcased:

* How **relational data** is managed and queried using SQL-based interfaces.
* The flexibility of **non-relational tools** like Cosmos DB and table storage.
* The power of **Fabric** to explore, visualize, and understand large datasets quickly.

This training reinforced foundational concepts that prepare me for cloud-based roles in data engineering, business intelligence, and analytics using Microsoft Azure.
